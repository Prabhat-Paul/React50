⚛️ React50 – My React Learning Journey

Welcome to React50 👋
This repository documents my hands-on journey of learning React, where I practice concepts, build small projects, and strengthen my understanding step by step.

The goal of this repo is consistent learning through practice — learning React not just by reading, but by building.

📌 About This Repository

React50 is a collection of:

Daily React practice exercises

Mini-projects

Concept-based implementations

Each folder or project represents something new I’ve learned or practiced while improving my React skills.

✅ React fundamentals (JSX, components, props)

✅ State & lifecycle (useState, useEffect)

✅ Event handling

✅ Conditional rendering

✅ Lists & keys

✅ Forms & controlled components

✅ Component reusability

✅ Basic project structure

✅ React best practices

⏳ More advanced topics coming soon...
